👋 Hi, I’m Asime James Oba a Microbiologist, Researcher and Sustainable Development Goals Advocate. For a long time I've wanted to start learning about programming which will be a change maker in my bioinformatics journey.

I've always been passionate about building workflows and pipelines for meta-omics data analysis using programming language and algorithms 

I  am an optimistic enthusiast who believes that if I didn't know how to do a particular thing, I will find out how to do it through learninig and unlearning. So programming has been a perfect fit for me to achieve my dreams and contribute to the body of knowledge.

👀 I am interested in Molecular Microbial Ecology, Plant Microbe Interactions, Environmental Microbiology, Biogeochemistry and Metagenomics 

🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python and looking for help with Data Structures & Algorithms 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source bioinformatics projects 

📫 How to reach me: asimejamesoba@gmail.com
I love books, movies and good food
